# CS1534 CA3 Assignment
A html website which showcases my hometowns tourist attractions for my CS1534 course.

## Design Aspects

**Navigation:**  The navigation consists of 3 pages, home, visit and history, it is only 3 pages as I believe that is plenty for the needs of the site, also preventing cluster and confusing the users. The order goes home, visit then history.  

**Layout:** The navigation bar has a simple yet effective layout, with "Stonehaven" on the left for clarity and branding, along with being another way to simply navigate back to the home page. "home", "visit", and "history" float to the right of the page, with them being ordered in relevance, as I believe if this is a website to attract tourists, having the visit page link to the left of the history link means the user is most likely to click visit first, as most people read left to right.  "Home" remains to the left of "Visit" as it is the first page you land on, it only makes sense to be the first page you read.   
   
For the layout of the home screen, a large banner containing an eyecatching high saturated image of the harbour which gives the users an immidiate sense of the town before they have to read anything, Along with a small text description below to further clarify what the image is.  Another simple line break is used followed by 2 columns, one containing text and the other containing another eyecatching image to further attract the user to the town.  Having 2 columns allows for simple responsiveness on smaller devices as the columns can stack.   

For the layour of the visit page, I utilised the 7:5 ratio with the column of 5 displaying text, and the column of 7 displaying a grid of bootstrap cards showing the essential experiences of the town, along with being able to click those cards to get further information on external sites.  The 5 column was placed on the left as it is the column the text is in, and the text should be read first to explain how the page works.  A map embedd of the town is also displayed below the text to further give an idea to the user of where the town is, with it being a google maps embedd, the user can then find the quickest way to travel to the town if they decide to do so.  The cards are placed in a 2x6 grid pattern so the user gets to see all the different experiences at once, allowing them to find something they may be interested at a faster pace.

On the history page, a 3 column grid is utilised to divide 3 descriptive ammounts of text, with simple headers to give an idea of what is in each passage along with visual elements to add to the visual appeal.  The text is quite descriptive as the demographic for tourists of this town usually consist of older folk, but simple punctuation is used to ensure anyone can still read if they wish to.

**Colour choices:** The main colour scheme is a simple 2 tone palette of pearly white colours to tie in with the connection of Stonehaven being a seaside town, giving the users a psychological sense of serenity, adding to the appeal of the website further promoting the town, along with them being easy to read off of with contrastnig Grey and Black text colours.
